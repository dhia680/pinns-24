# Pinns Playground

## Overview
Pinns-playground is an academic research project conducted by a group of three students (Nicolas, Dhia, Simon) from the Math and CS department at Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussees, in collaboration with Airbus (Antoine Bensalah, Sofian Haddad, Ali Hebbal) and supervision of Pr. Eric Duceau. <br>
The project explores Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving Helmholtz Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).

## Objectives
- Investigate the efficiency of PINNs in solving Helmholtz PDEs.
- Address challenges such as multi-objective loss and performance drops of MLP in high-frequency settings.
- Propose ideas such as static and dynamic loss balancing and the use of Fourier features for high frequencies.

## Ideas
- Example implementations of PINNs for Helmholtz PDEs.
- Experimental code to test ideas related to loss balancing and Fourier features.

## Note:
 - This repo contains few notebooks used during this project.
 - Code might need further cleaning / organization.
